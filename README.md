**Linux Xorg/evdev setups for multi buttons devices like "CYBORG R.A.T." mouse (16 actions for all buttons).**



================================================================

Those settings has been tested on Funtoo/Gentoo and Arch Linux machines with the latest Xorg & also with the latest kernel 3.6 >

================================================================

Testing machines:

-Gentoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Funtoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Arch (64bit)

================================================================
**TECH STUFF:**

Gentoo profile ~ current
Funtoo standard profile

Kernel line is: 
Linux from 3.6> to current

===============================================================

This mouse settings are working with all current linux kernels and mods. You can use this setups for any kernel mod (pf-kernel, ck-kernel, etc..) it should works.

==============================================================
**MOUSE TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

-Mouse with Very Low Latency 2.4Ghz Wireless or with cable (v.3 and v.7);

-6400 DPI (track approx up to 6 meters per second);

-Buttons-

-2 regular left and right mouse buttons

-4 Custom DPI Settings

-6 Programmable Buttons

-3 Cyborg Modes

-A total of 8 buttons.

==============================================================

All settings are fully customizable and transferable between different mouse models

(I believe that problem with 'setting up' pro-mouse (I mean mouse with more then 2 or 3 buttons) in the linux graphical environment is wider then 
MadCatz R.A.T.s mouses) and these settings could be used also with other mice models/vendors.

-It is only amount of buttons to setup correctly to work with other mouse models/vendors.
