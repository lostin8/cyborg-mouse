Linux Xorg/evdev setups for multi buttons devices like "CYBORG R.A.T." mouse (16 actions for all buttons).

================================================================

Those settings has been tested on Funtoo/Gentoo and Arch Linux machines with the latest Xorg & also with the latest kernel 3.6 >

================================================================

-Gentoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Funtoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Arch 64bit

-this mouse settings are working with all current linux kernels and mods;

==============================================================
MOUSE TECHNICAL DETAILS:

-Mouse with Very Low Latency 2.4Ghz Wireless or with cable (v.3 and v.7);

-6400 DPI (track approx up to 6 meters per second);

-Buttons-

-2 regular left and right mouse buttons

-4 Custom DPI Settings

-6 Programmable Buttons

-3 Cyborg Modes

-A total of 8 buttons.

==============================================================

All settings are fully customizable and transferable between different mouse models

(I believe that problem with setting up pro-mouse in the linux environment is wider then 
MadCatz R.A.T.s) and these settings could be used with other mice models/vendors.

-It is only amount of buttons to setup correctly with other models.
