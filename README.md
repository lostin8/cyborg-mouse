**Linux Xorg/evdev setups for multi buttons devices like "CYBORG R.A.T." mouse (16 actions for all buttons).**




Those settings has been tested on Funtoo/Gentoo/Arch and Ubuntu Linux machines with the latest Xorg. This workaround works with kernel 2.6 and with the latest kernel 3.. & 4.. > current. (nothing has changed - evdev still can't work with this class of devices *and it is May 2015.. :/ ).

====================================================================

Testing machines:

-Gentoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Funtoo with current profile (~amd64)
-Arch (64bit)
-Ubuntu (tested from 14.04 to 15.04 (and 15.10 too)

====================================================================

**TECH STUFF:**

Gentoo profile ~ current
Funtoo standard profile

Kernel line is: 
Linux from 2.6 all versions > to current (nobody care about older stuff - right?)

====================================================================

This mouse settings are working with all current linux kernels and mods. You can use this setups for any kernel mod (pf-kernel, ck-kernel, etc..) it should works.

====================================================================

**MOUSE TECHNICAL DETAILS:**

-Mouse with Very Low Latency 2.4Ghz Wireless or Cable Versions (v.3 and v.7);

-6400 DPI (track approx up to 6 meters per second);

-Buttons-

-2 regular left and right mouse buttons

-4 Custom DPI Settings

-6 Programmable Buttons

-3 Cyborg Modes

-A total of: 8 buttons.

==============================================================

All settings are fully customizable and transferable between different mouse models

(I believe that problem with 'setting up' pro-mouses (pro - I mean mouse with more then 2 or 3 buttons) in the linux environment is wider than 
MadCatz R.A.T.s mouses) and these settings could be also be used with other mice makers/models/vendors.

-It is only amount of buttons to setup correctly to work with other mouse makers/models/vendors.
