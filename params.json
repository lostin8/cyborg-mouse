Mouses I decided to write my own evdev settings & configs for it. Actually there is a few well known problems with this mouse series, starting from: most keys is not binded at all; 'panoramic wheel' is not working; battery is working shorter then in Windows/Mac; program buttons are a terrible issue, aiming button is only for decoration, etc..\r\nIf you have mouse from this series and you can support me and test those settings I'll be very happy to know any of your thoughts, proposals about it.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n[@lostin8](https://github.com/lostin8) aka [Rafal Kruk](http://kruk.co) is responsible for all the chaos here. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this page?
